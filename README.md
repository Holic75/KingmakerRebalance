# Call of the Wild

This is Pathfinder: Kingmaker mod.

- Starting from version 1.57 the mod is no longer compatible with Eldritch Arcana.
- If you are using mod version prior to 1.57 (or no mod at all) and have characters who are polymorphed, wait till polymorph effect expires.
- Save games with primal companion hunter, are no longer compatible, so respec out of the archetype is required prior to 1.68 update.
- If you have animal companions with animal growth buff, wait till it expires, before updating to 1.68
- If you have characters with Quicken Blessing feat, respec them so they do not have it, before updating to 1.72,
- Advanced fighter training options from 1.77 are not compatible with Advanced Martial Arts Mod, you can deactivate them if you prefer the latter.
- Wizard Discoveries from 1.81 might conflict with those from The Lost Grimoire Mod, you can disable them in setting.json.

Mod is only expected to work with  2.08 English version of Enhanced Edition of the game.

Known Issues:
- Sometimes when playing Hunter/Summoner, companion abilities (animal foci, teamwork feats, fiendish or celestial templates, evolutions) might disappear after level up. It seems that deactivating all companion abilities (like power attack) and saving the game (no need to reload)  brings all missing abilities back. Same issue happens with newly created mercenaries, it resolves itself when you leave the capital/varnhold/trading post or enter the endless dungeon.
- If you start summoner/primal companion hunter level-up and then abort the process, your eidolon will lose all of its evolutions and will not regain them until you finish level-up.

enchanced attacks,
- sets base skill points of every classes to 1/2 of pnp value (as per consolidated skill rules), and gives bonus skill points to humans and half-orcs only at even levels, since most skills in the game correspond to 2 skills in pnp (optional),
- replaces favored enemy for Sacred Huntsmaster with animal focus as per pnp (optional),
- fixes Magic Vestment spell to work as per pnp rules,  
- Rangers now should get improvement of their favored terrain bonuses,
- Legendary proportions increases size by only one category and changes Natural Armor bonus to untyped (instead of enchancement),
- Animal Growth properly increases size of animal companion,
- Barbarian Increased Damage Reduction rage power works only during rage, same for Stalwart Defender,
- Empyreal Sorcerer Channel Energy ability depends now on Wisdom rather than Charisma,
- Channel Energy dc no longer scales with character level, but with class level that gave access to it.
- all flying creatures are immune to difficult terrain and ground based buff effects and also receive +3 dodge melee ac bonus against non-flying creatures,
- Fiery Body and Angelic Aspects now also give ability to fly,
- flails and heavy flails critical multiplier was changed to x3 to compensate for missing trip and disarm properties (optional),
- medium range for spells was increased to 60 ft, long range to 100 ft,
- weapon swap consumes move action instead of standard,
- spell casting is not forbidden while in elemental form (optional),
- allied spellcaster now should additionally give +1 cl and +2 spell penetration if adjacent with this feat teammates have the same spell available (optional)
- changes range of Wail of Banshee and Polar Midnight to medium (since by the time you can cast these spells in pnp the range will be around 65 ft),
- fixes ecclesitheurge to be as per pnp rules (no bonus skill point, no channel energy damage increase at level 3) (optional),
- when using kinetic healer ability, burn cost can be optionally offloaded to the target,
- Kineticists now receive internal buffer ability (as in pnp),
- Kineticists blast abilities type is changed to spell-like,

- Ranger can only select dog, elk, leopard, lizard or wolf as her animal companion through hunter's bond feature,
- Ranger now shares her favored enemy and favored terrain bonuses with her animal companion,
- Animate Dead spell works more akin to pnp (you need a corpse to raise a skeleton, and skeleton retains corpse's stats, size, HD and equipment, and lasts 10 minutes/cl, caster can not raise more than 4 * caster level HD of skeletons),
- Flamedancer bard receives Song of the Fiery Gaze at level 3, he receives Fire Break Fire Dance at level 6 as per pnp rules,

- Optionally makes all rake (like last 2 smilodon claw attacks) and similar attacks secondary, i.e. they receive -5 penalty (reduced to -2 with multiattack). This is not a pnp-accurate fix, but since rake normally works only on grappled opponents it seems to make sense,
- all Animal Companions/Eidolons receive multiattack at appropriate levels,
- Grease spell was changed to work more in line with pnp (uses dc 10 mobility check instead of dc, and only if unit moves).

- Singing Steel works properly,

- Fixed incorrect calculation of burn cost for kinetic blade and blade whirlwind abilities,
- Polymorph no longer puts a lock on inventory slots (they still stay inaccessible though) to avoid preventing temporary weapons and limbs from removal when corresponding buffs expire, as a side effect it also allows to loot body under baleful polymorph.
- Fixed issue where certain domains (mostly for druids) did not allow to use non-domain spells if they had lower level than that on domain list (respec is required),
- Fixed missing druid scaling on 1st level Weather domain ability,
- Monks no longer gain their AC bonus if using shield and fighting unarmored,
- (Greater) Elemental Focus feat should now correctly work with kineticist substance infusions.
